    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade Peach Crumb Bars are a delightful treat that showcases the juicy and aromatic <br>
        flavors of fresh peaches. These bars consist of three delicious layers: a buttery and  <br>
        crumbly base, a luscious peach filling, and a crunchy crumb topping. The base layer provides <br>
         a sturdy yet tender foundation, while the sweet and tangy peach filling bursts with the natural <br>
          sweetness of ripe peaches. The crumb topping adds a delightful texture and a hint of nuttiness, <br>
           making each bite a delightful combination of flavors and textures. Whether enjoyed as a dessert <br>
           or a snack, these Homemade Peach Crumb Bars are the perfect way to savor the vibrant taste of 
           summer peaches in a portable and irresistible treat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar/li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>10 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cold water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat an 8x8-inch baking pan with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Next, cut in the cold butter using <br>
         2 forks or a pastry cutter then slowly mix in the egg yolk and cold water. Don't worry if the dough <br>
         seems really crumbly; it should be!</li>
    <li>Press 1/2 of the crumble mixture into the prepared pan to make the crust. Save the rest for the top of the bars.</li>
    <li>Stir together peach slices, sugar, flour, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg until combined. <br>
         Evenly add peach filling to the top of the crust.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the remaining crumble over the peach filling.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set, <br>
         30 to 38 minutes. Cool bars to room temperature, then cut and serve.</li>
