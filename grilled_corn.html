    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled Corn with Cilantro Lime Butter is a delectable recipe that combines the smoky <br>
    flavors of grilled corn with the refreshing taste of tangy cilantro lime butter. The corn <br>
    is grilled to perfection, imparting a slightly charred and caramelized exterior while retaining <br>
    its juicy sweetness. The star of the dish is the flavorful cilantro lime butter, made by blending <br>
    fresh cilantro, zesty lime juice, and creamy butter. This compound butter is generously slathered over <br>
    the warm grilled corn, infusing it with a burst of herbaceous and citrusy notes. The combination of the <br>
    charred corn and the vibrant cilantro lime butter creates a harmonious balance of flavors, making it a delightful <br>
    and irresistible side dish for any summer gathering or barbecue.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup butter</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>8 ears corn on the cob, unhusked</li>
    <li>3 quarts cold water, or as needed to cover</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cream butter in a bowl until smooth; mix in cilantro, lime juice, and cayenne pepper until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate 1 hour to blend flavors.</li>
    <li>Peel husks back from ears of corn starting at the top, leaving the husks attached at the bottom of the ears. Remove all the corn silk and close husks over the ears again. Cover corn ears with cold water in a large bowl until husks are thoroughly soaked, about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Place the corn in husks onto the hot grate and grill covered until husks are charred and the corn kernels are tender, 20 to 25 minutes, turning often. Strip off husks and serve corn with cilantro lime butter.</li>
